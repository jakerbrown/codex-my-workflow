# Workflow Integration Overlay Template

Use this template when a repository already has its own specialized agents,
planning documents, and domain workflows, but you want to layer this workflow's
methods on top without replacing what already works.

## Integration principle

Treat this workflow as an **overlay**, not a rewrite.

Preserve:

- existing specialized agents
- existing plan documents and folders
- existing domain-specific review and verification steps
- existing project structure that already works

Add:

- root orchestration guidance
- durable memory files if missing
- a clearer completion standard
- explicit verification and review expectations
- a default multi-agent review mapping
- a scoped adversarial-review rule for high-stakes work
- a durable session-log habit if the repo lacks one

## Minimal files to add

If missing, add only these first:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- one durable place for plans
- one durable place for session logs or equivalent progress notes

You do not need to force the repo into `quality_reports/` if it already has a
good durable location for plans and logs.

## Root `AGENTS.md` overlay

Copy and adapt:

```md
# Workflow Guidance

This repository uses an overlay workflow layer. Preserve the repo's existing
agents, plans, and domain-specific procedures unless this file explicitly says
otherwise.

## Core operating mode

- For any non-trivial task, start with or refresh a plan in `[EXISTING PLAN PATH]`.
- Before substantial edits, read `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and any
  relevant domain guidance already used by this repo.
- After plan approval, use:

  `implement -> verify -> review -> fix -> re-verify -> summarize`

- Save important reasoning to disk rather than leaving it only in chat.
- Update `[EXISTING SESSION LOG PATH OR EQUIVALENT]` after plan approval, major
  decisions, and wrap-up.

## Existing infrastructure is authoritative

- Existing specialized agents remain the default specialists for this repo.
- Existing plan documents remain the default planning surface for this repo.
- Existing verification commands remain the default technical checks for this
  repo unless they are explicitly amended.

## Review expectations

- Use the repo's existing specialists when the task maps cleanly onto them.
- If multiple specialists apply, prefer parallel multi-agent review rather than
  a single generalist pass when the task is large enough to justify it.
- Keep the repo's existing specialists authoritative; map workflow roles onto
  them instead of renaming the repo to fit this workflow.
- Treat the mapping as a workflow default, not an automatic platform feature:
  explicitly request the relevant specialists when you want the full review
  pass.
- If specialist review is skipped, say why in the final summary.

## Verification expectations

- Match verification to the change:
  - code changes: run the narrowest relevant tests, linters, or scripts
  - docs changes: re-read the edited docs and verify referenced paths/commands
  - generated outputs: confirm artifacts exist and are current
- Record what was verified and what was not.

## Completion standard

Before declaring a task done, be explicit about:

- what changed
- what was verified
- what review agents or review steps were used
- what durable artifacts were updated
- any remaining blockers, drift, or open questions
```

## Default multi-agent mapping

For a research or public-artifact repo such as referenda, start from a
copy-ready block like this and then replace each role with the repo's actual
specialists:

```md
## Default specialist mapping

- Data ingest / transformation / analysis changes: use `[analysis-reviewer]`,
  `[domain-reviewer]`, and `[verifier]`
- Result tables / figures / maps / released artifacts: use
  `[artifact-reviewer]`, `[domain-reviewer]`, and `[verifier]`
- Workflow / automation / repo-governance changes: use `[workflow-reviewer]`
  and `[verifier]`
- Documentation or methods changes that make substantive claims: use
  `[docs-reviewer]` and `[domain-reviewer]`
- Exploratory work proposed for promotion into production paths: use
  `[implementation-reviewer]` and `[verifier]`
- Final verification: use `[verifier]` or `[repo-standard check suite]`
```

If a change crosses multiple surfaces, run the relevant specialists in
parallel and synthesize one durable report instead of treating review as a
single-role gate.

For referenda-style work, the default expectation is usually:

- one reviewer for implementation correctness
- one reviewer for substantive election or domain correctness
- one verification owner for reproducibility, artifact freshness, or command checks

## Existing-agent mapping table

Add a section like this to `AGENTS.md` or a local workflow doc:

```md
## Specialist mapping

| Workflow role | Existing repo agent / reviewer | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation specialist | `[agent-name]` | `[task types]` |
| Code reviewer | `[agent-name]` | `[task types]` |
| Domain reviewer | `[agent-name]` | `[task types]` |
| Verifier | `[agent-name or command suite]` | `[task types]` |
| Release / packaging reviewer | `[agent-name]` | `[task types]` |
```

This lets the methodology transfer even if agent names differ from this repo.

For a referenda-style repo, a practical mapping might look like:

```md
## Specialist mapping

| Workflow role | Existing repo agent / reviewer | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis-code reviewer | `[analysis-reviewer]` | Data prep, joins, transformations, statistical or tabulation code |
| Domain reviewer | `[elections-domain-reviewer]` | Ballot-measure logic, jurisdiction rules, interpretive claims |
| Workflow reviewer | `[workflow-reviewer]` | `AGENTS.md`, automation, release instructions, infra docs |
| Artifact reviewer | `[artifact-reviewer]` | Tables, figures, maps, exported outputs, public-facing docs |
| Verifier | `[qa-runner or command suite]` | Repro runs, artifact freshness, smoke checks |
| Adversarial critic | `[red-team reviewer]` | Scoped high-stakes surfaces |
| Fixer | `[implementation owner]` | Address critic findings without expanding scope |
```

## Scoped adversarial-review rule

Adversarial review should be **narrowly scoped**, not globally required.

Use a rule like this in the target repo:

```md
## High-stakes adversarial review

- Default rule:
  - Use the repo's standard specialist review path for normal changes.
- Escalate to an adversarial critic/fixer or red-team/rebuttal pass only when
  the change is high-stakes.
- Treat these as high-stakes by default:
  - transformation logic that can change released counts, classifications, or
    jurisdiction-level results
  - methods text, documentation, or release notes tied to published findings or
    public claims
  - workflow rules, automation, or verification logic that can silently weaken
    review, reproducibility, or artifact freshness
  - release or deployment commands that can overwrite, publish, or invalidate
    public artifacts
  - destructive or difficult-to-reverse data migrations, backfills, or archive
    rewrites
- If adversarial review is used, record:
  - why the change qualified as high-stakes
  - what exact files, commands, or claims were in scope
  - which critic/reviewer roles were used
  - what verification or rollback checks were added
- If the change is important but not high-stakes, use normal multi-agent review
  plus the repo's narrow verification suite instead of forcing a red-team loop.
```

This preserves the spirit of adversarial QA without accidentally making every
routine repo or docs change pay the cost of a heavyweight review loop.

## Existing-plan integration block

Document the repo's actual durable planning surfaces:

```md
## Durable state locations

- Plans live in: `[path]`
- Session logs live in: `[path]`
- Review reports live in: `[path]`
- Verification notes live in: `[path or "same as above"]`
```

If the repo already has ADRs, issue templates, runbooks, or milestone docs, use
them rather than creating duplicate planning systems.

## `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` starter

Use this for stable repo truth:

```md
# Knowledge Base

## Canonical conventions

| Area | Convention | Example | Anti-pattern |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Fill in | Fill in | Fill in |
| Naming | Fill in | Fill in | Fill in |
| Verification | Fill in | Fill in | Fill in |

## Important artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fill in | Fill in | Fill in | Fill in |

## Known pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Fill in | Fill in | Fill in |
```

## `MEMORY.md` starter

Use this for workflow lessons:

```md
# Workflow Memory

[LEARN] YYYY-MM-DD — short title
Context:
Lesson:
Action:
```

Good early entries:

- where Codex tends to stumble in this repo
- which existing specialists are most reliable for which tasks
- which specialist combinations are the default multi-agent review sets
- which change classes should trigger adversarial review
- which verification steps are easy to forget
- what should always be written to disk during longer tasks

## Integration checklist

Use this when adopting the overlay in a repo:

- Keep the repo's existing agents and planning docs.
- Add or update a root `AGENTS.md` with overlay orchestration rules.
- Document where plans, logs, and reports already live.
- Map existing agents to workflow roles and define the default multi-agent
  review combinations.
- Define which change classes count as high-stakes enough for adversarial
  review.
- Add `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` and `MEMORY.md` if missing.
- Make verification and completion standards explicit.
- Do one pilot task and refine the overlay from what you learn.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Replacing good existing agents just to match another repo's names.
- Introducing a second planning system when the repo already has one.
- Copying slide- or domain-specific rules into unrelated repos.
- Making the overlay so broad that it overrides useful local conventions.
- Requiring adversarial review for routine changes that only need standard
  specialist review plus verification.
- Treating verification or review as optional once implementation is done.
