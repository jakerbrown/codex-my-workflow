# Minimal Workflow Overlay Usage

Use [minimal-workflow-overlay-kit.md](/Users/jacobbrown/Documents/GitHub/codex-my-workflow/templates/minimal-workflow-overlay-kit.md) when rolling this workflow out across many repos.

## Recommended rollout order

For each repo:

1. Find the repo's existing plan path.
2. Find the repo's existing session-log or durable progress-note path.
3. Identify the repo's default specialists or review commands.
4. Identify the narrowest standard verification commands.
5. Pick the quality threshold.
6. Define which high-stakes changes should escalate to adversarial review.
7. Drop the copy-ready `AGENTS.md` overlay into the repo and fill in the six fields.

## Fast fill-in worksheet

```text
PLAN_PATH=
SESSION_LOG_PATH=
SPECIALIST_MAP=
VERIFY_COMMANDS=
QUALITY_THRESHOLD=
HIGH_STAKES_RULE=
```

## Example

```text
PLAN_PATH=docs/plans/
SESSION_LOG_PATH=docs/session_logs/
SPECIALIST_MAP=Backend/code changes: use backend-reviewer + verifier; Docs changes: use docs-reviewer; Final verification: use verifier
VERIFY_COMMANDS=pytest -q; ruff check .
QUALITY_THRESHOLD=80
HIGH_STAKES_RULE=release-critical behavior, security-sensitive changes, and correctness-sensitive simulation or data logic
```

## When to use the broader overlay instead

Use [workflow-integration-overlay.md](/Users/jacobbrown/Documents/GitHub/codex-my-workflow/templates/workflow-integration-overlay.md) instead when:

- the repo has unusual planning/reporting structure
- the repo needs a more explicit agent-role mapping table
- the repo needs default multi-agent review mappings by change type
- the repo needs a scoped adversarial-review rule for high-stakes changes
- the repo lacks `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` and `MEMORY.md`
- the repo needs more detailed orchestration guidance

## Best practice

Start with the minimal kit in every repo, then only graduate a repo to the
broader overlay or starter pack if that repo proves it needs more structure.
