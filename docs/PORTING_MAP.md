# Porting Map

This document maps the original Claude workflow structure to the Codex-first
starter pack in this repository.

## Status legend

- **Direct**: close conceptual and file-level equivalent exists
- **Emulated**: behavior is recreated with different Codex primitives
- **No direct equivalent**: the starter pack approximates the behavior but cannot
  recreate it exactly with currently documented Codex features

## Core mapping

| Claude source | Codex destination | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` + nested `AGENTS.md` + `docs/CODEX_WORKFLOW.md` | Emulated | Codex uses layered `AGENTS.md` rather than Claude's project memory surface |
| `.claude/settings.json` | `.codex/config.toml` + `.codex/hooks.json` + `.codex/rules/default.rules` | Emulated | Same control plane split across config, hooks, and rules |
| `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.codex/agents/*.toml` | Direct | Custom Codex agents map cleanly to the specialist-agent concept |
| `.claude/skills/*` | `.agents/skills/*` | Direct | Codex skills are repo-native and share a similar folder model |
| `.claude/rules/plan-first-workflow.md` | `AGENTS.md` + `templates/plan.md` + hook reminders | Emulated | Planning is encoded in guidance and disk artifacts |
| `.claude/rules/orchestrator-protocol.md` | `AGENTS.md` + `docs/CODEX_WORKFLOW.md` + skills | Emulated | Same loop, but not a native built-in Codex protocol |
| `.claude/rules/session-logging.md` | `quality_reports/session_logs/` + templates + hooks | Direct | Same on-disk pattern |
| `.claude/rules/knowledge-base-template.md` | `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` | Direct | Promoted to a first-class root artifact |
| `.claude/rules/beamer-quarto-sync.md` | `Slides/AGENTS.md` + `Quarto/AGENTS.md` | Emulated | Directory guidance replaces path-scoped rule loading |
| `.claude/rules/r-code-conventions.md` | `scripts/AGENTS.md` + `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` | Emulated | File-based guidance, not standalone path rules |
| `.claude/rules/exploration-*` | `explorations/AGENTS.md` | Emulated | Same behavior through nested guidance |
| `.claude/rules/pdf-processing.md` | `master_supporting_docs/AGENTS.md` | Emulated | Same idea through directory-local guidance |
| `.claude/hooks/PreCompact` flow | on-disk plans/logs + `SessionStart` + `Stop` hooks | No direct equivalent | Current Codex docs do not expose a `PreCompact` hook |
| Claude `PreToolUse` for `Edit|Write` | Codex `PreToolUse` on `Bash` + repo rules | No direct equivalent | Current Codex hook interception is Bash-oriented |
| Claude notification hook | omitted in starter pack | No direct equivalent | Can be added later if a suitable app / local integration is desired |

## Specialist agent mapping

| Claude agent | Codex agent file |
|---|---|
| `proofreader` | `.codex/agents/proofreader.toml` |
| `slide-auditor` | `.codex/agents/slide-auditor.toml` |
| `pedagogy-reviewer` | `.codex/agents/pedagogy-reviewer.toml` |
| `r-reviewer` | `.codex/agents/r-reviewer.toml` |
| `tikz-reviewer` | `.codex/agents/tikz-reviewer.toml` |
| `beamer-translator` | `.codex/agents/beamer-translator.toml` |
| `quarto-critic` | `.codex/agents/quarto-critic.toml` |
| `quarto-fixer` | `.codex/agents/quarto-fixer.toml` |
| `verifier` | `.codex/agents/verifier.toml` |
| `domain-reviewer` | `.codex/agents/domain-reviewer.toml` |

The current specialist-agent inventory matches the original Claude-side agent
names one-for-one at the file level.

## Skill mapping in this starter pack

| Original skill | Codex status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/slide-excellence` | Implemented | Uses explicit parallel subagent spawning |
| `/qa-quarto` | Implemented | Uses explicit critic/fixer loop |
| `/proofread` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/proofread/` |
| `/visual-audit` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/visual-audit/` |
| `/pedagogy-review` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/pedagogy-review/` |
| `/review-r` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/review-r/` |
| `/translate-to-quarto` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/translate-to-quarto/` |
| `/context-status` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/context-status/` |
| `/learn` | Implemented in repo | Present under `.agents/skills/learn/` |
| additional workflow / research skills | Implemented in repo | The repo now contains broader workflow, lecture, and research skills beyond the original flagship pair |

The current skill inventory also matches the original Claude-side skill names
one-for-one at the directory level.

## What the starter pack already includes

- root guidance
- nested directory guidance
- repo config
- repo hooks
- repo rules
- 10 specialist custom agents
- knowledge base and memory scaffolding
- plan / log / quality templates
- quality-report directory scaffolding
- a broader skill library spanning slide QA, workflow utilities, lecture authoring, and research support

## Next likely porting waves

### Wave 2
- populate `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` with real durable conventions
- validate existing skills against the original Claude workflow intent
- tighten verification guidance for infrastructure files, skills, hooks, and rules
- document a lightweight read-only reconnaissance mode for planning tasks

### Wave 3
- add or refine verification wrappers for repeatable infra checks
- improve report synthesis and quality-score reporting across skills
- run end-to-end pilot tasks to harden the current Codex workflow in practice

### Wave 4
- app local-environment setup
- automations
- optional Agents SDK orchestrator
- CI / GitHub Action integration

## Recommended principle

Do not try to force Codex to imitate every Claude mechanism literally.

Prefer:
- a faithful **workflow outcome**
- small, composable Codex-native artifacts
- explicit subagent spawning
- durable files on disk for state
